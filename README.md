# wk4-webapi-code-quiz

The purpose of this project was to create a functional quiz page with dynamic elements while keeping it friendly for mobile and tablet users. The quiz opens with a landing page then clears the contents in order to dynamic generate quiz questions/answers pulled from an array of objects. Scores are calculated at the end of each quiz attempt and are available for local storage to be viewed under Highscores. 

The project is viewable live at: https://brigittepowers.github.io/wk4-webapi-code-quiz/
